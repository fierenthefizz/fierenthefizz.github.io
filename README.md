# Fieren's Startpage

This startpage is the first one I've ever done, I'll surely do reworks and the such but I want a basic landing page for my other projects.

### What do it do?

It's just a basic html page with a simple js script for a duckduckgo search (won't change, it's comfier than google) that grabs a random number to grab a picture from the little gallery, then it picks the css for the specific image (which I still havent done!). It also has the links for the pages I use and I'll be updating it with the pages I myself I'm working on.

### What does it not do?

This is not an expert page by any means, so don't come looking for a nice aesthetic startpage for your /html-css/ sh*tposting.

### To-do

1) Re-organize: I haven't touched it in a few months, I need to re-organize every link, set it up correctly, and decide what links I should put in it.

2) Put up Creamy's list: It's the second proyect I'm working on, it's a funky 20k line behemoth so I'm taking my time organizing it to my preference, it'll have its own little to-do too once I upload it.

3) Work on styling: Yeah I know it's not cute, I'm planning on making all the text negative but I'll test if that looks okay.

4) ETC.: This is for smaller stuff like adding more images, adding other projects, etc.
