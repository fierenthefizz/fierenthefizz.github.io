# Fieren's Startpage

This startpage is the first one I've ever done, I'll surely do reworks and the such but I want a basic landing page for my other projects.

### What do it do?

It's just a basic html page with a simple js script for a duckduckgo search (won't change, it's comfier than google), and one that grabs a random number to grab a picture from the little gallery, then it inverts the color of the image on the text for visibility. It also has the links for the pages I use and I'll be updating it with the pages I myself I'm working on.

### What does it not do?

This is not an expert page by any means, so don't come looking for a nice aesthetic startpage for your /html-css/ sh*tposting.

### To-do

1) Re-organize: I haven't touched it in a few months, I need to re-organize every link, set it up correctly, and decide what links I should put in it.

2) Continue Working on the list: The list is already up and accesible through the main page, now I have to continue working. What's left is:

    -Boorus

    -Miscellaneous pages

    -Re-work the page itself to be more appealing to the eye

    -Add more pages as I go.

3) Work on styling: Negative has been added to the temporal html, which I use for tests like this, it'll be surely added next update to the main html.

4) ETC.: This is for smaller stuff like adding more images, adding other projects, etc.
